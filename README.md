# -Building-RAG-Agents-with-LLMs
This course teaches practical deployment of retrieval-based LLMs. Learn to compose predictable LLM systems, design dialog and document reasoning, leverage embeddings for retrieval and guardrailing, and implement RAG agents for question answering. Topics include LLM interfaces, LangChain, embeddings, and vector stores.
These are Tutorials and exercises that I have completed in the NVIDIA course 'Building RAG Agents with LLM'. Enjoy
